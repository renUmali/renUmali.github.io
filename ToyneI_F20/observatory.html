"It’s weird. If you’re running late and then elevators can be the most annoying thing ever. You can’t control when they arrive or how many stops it will make. It’s just a moment were everything is truly out of your hand.",
"It can be hard to not worry, or stress, about what’s happening next. To want time to slow down or speed up. There was a part of me that loved living in a building where I took the elevator every day because no matter what it forced me to stop for a moment and take a breath.",
"It reminded me that no matter what time moves forward at its own pace, and I need to be okay with that.",
"Being all the way out here now I think it helps me to not worry about time. I know that it took a lot of stress getting here, and that in the future there’ll be a lot of stress again, but right now all I can do is wait.",

We were working hard but it was for a reason that we believed in. We were fighting for a change.","And now we’re all the way out here and it feels like our problems are so far away now.","We’re on this trip and we don’t know exactly how long it will take.","But part of me doesn’t even want to get there.","Because right here in this moment I know that things aren’t hectic, or scary.","Everything just is.","And I like that.","While it lasts.","Sorry for rambling about home—I mean earth again.

At least not recently.","But maybe this is “normal” now.","Or maybe nothing is. Out here there’s nothing to compare ourselves too. Other than memories.","But we left for a reason looking back probably does more harm than good right?","Even if I didn’t want to be here I am now, and I don’t think I could have done things differently.","And these stars really are beautiful.","I’m glad I have someone to share them with"];

A life is a long time","But life is also a finite time.","Maybe I should have fought more to do what I could as quickly as I could.","It’s honestly hard for me to come to terms with the idea that I can’t do everything.","I feel like there’s so much I want out of life but no matter how much I try I’ll need to choose what I really want to do.","And just accept that everything else will just not be a thing I get to experience.","All that being said…","I think it’s safe to assume no one has experienced THIS before!
